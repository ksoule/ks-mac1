<h1> ooh, a list </h1>
<p> what goes into each drink varies by planet and local custom. however the basis of each drink remains constant. for example, a rum and coke may contain a lime, lemon, or even a sprig of mint on earth, but would have an avocado-esque garnish on Yavin 4. It would also be distilled tree sap rather than sugar.</p>
<p> here are some of the most common drinks in the universe.
  <ul>
      <li> Vodka n coke </li>
      <li> Cosmopolitan </li>
      <li> Harvey Wallbanger </li>
  <</ul>
